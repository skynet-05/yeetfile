## About

YeetFile is a file vault and file/text transferring service, with both a
[web](https://yeetfile.com) and [CLI
client](https://github.com/benbusby/yeetfile/releases) officially supported, 
and all features of the web client are available from the CLI client.

All content is encrypted locally, and the server is incapable of decrypting any
transmitted content.

In addition to having an official instance maintained at [https://yeetfile.com
](https://yeetfile.com), YeetFile is [easily self-hosted](#self-hosting) and can
be configured to store encrypted file data locally on the server, in [Backblaze B2](
https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage), or using any S3-compatible storage providers 
(such as AWS, [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/cloud-object-storage), 
[MinIO](https://min.io), etc).

## How It Works / Security

See: [https://docs.yeetfile.com/security](https://docs.yeetfile.com/security/)

## Self-Hosting

You can quickly create your own instance of YeetFile using `docker compose`:

`docker compose up`

This will create the Postgres db and the server running on
http://localhost:8090. You can modify the docker-compose.yml to use an external
data volume by running `docker volume create --name=yeetfile_data` and
including the following in your docker-compose.yml:

```
volumes:
  yeetfile_data:
    external: true
```

You should create your own `.env` file with whichever variables needed to customize your instance
(see: [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).

#### Storage

Encrypted file content can be stored either locally on the machine, in Backblaze B2, or using an
S3-compatible storage solution.

To enable:

- Backblaze B2
  - Set `YEETFILE_STORAGE=b2`
  - Set all [Backblaze environment variables](#backblaze-environment-variables)
- S3
  - Set `YEETFILE_STORAGE=s3`
  - Set all [S3 environment variables](#s3-environment-variables)
- Local storage
  - Set `YEETFILE_STORAGE=local`
  - (Optional) Set [local storage environment variables](#local-storage-environment-variables)

#### Access

When self-hosting, the web interface must be accessed either from a secure context (HTTPS/TLS) or
from the same machine the service is hosted on (`localhost` or `0.0.0.0`).

If you need to access the web interface using a machine IP on your network, for example, you can
generate a cert and set the `YEETFILE_TLS_CERT` and `YEETFILE_TLS_KEY` environment variables (see
[Environment Variables](#environment-variables))

> [!NOTE]
> This does not apply to the CLI tool. You can still use all features of YeetFile from the CLI tool
> without a secure connection.

#### Email Registration

To set up email registration for your self-hosted instance, you need to define the following environment
variables:

```sh
# The email address to use for correspondence
YEETFILE_EMAIL_ADDR=...

# The host of the email address being used
YEETFILE_EMAIL_HOST=...

# The port of the email host
YEETFILE_EMAIL_PORT=...

# The SMTP login for the email address
YEETFILE_EMAIL_USER=...

# The SMTP password for the email address
YEETFILE_EMAIL_PASSWORD=...
```

#### Administration

You can declare yourself as the admin of your instance by setting the
`YEETFILE_INSTANCE_ADMIN` environment variable to your YeetFile account ID or
email address.

This will allow you to manage users and their files on the instance. Note that
file names are encrypted, but you will be able to see the following metadata
for each file:

- File ID
- Last Modified
- Size
- Owner ID

#### Logging

Endpoints beginning with `/api/...` should be monitored for error codes to prevent bruteforcing.

For example:

- `/login` is the endpoint for the login web page, this only loads static content
    - This will always return a `200` response, since there is nothing sensitive about loading
      the login page.
- `/api/login` is the endpoint for submitting credentials
    - This can return an error code depending on the failure (i.e. `403` for invalid credentials,
      `404` for a non-existent user, etc)

You can limit requests to all `/api` endpoints in a Nginx config, for example, with something like
this:

```nginx
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=api_limit:10m rate=10r/m;

// ...

location /api/ {
    limit_req zone=api_limit burst=20 nodelay;
    proxy_pass http://backend;
}
```

## CLI Configuration

The YeetFile CLI tool can be configured using a `config.yml` file in the following path:

**Linux/macOS**: `~/.config/yeetfile/config.yml`

**Windows**: `%AppData%\yeetfile\config.yml`

When you initially launch the CLI tool, it will create this directory and add a default `config.yml`:

```yml
server: https://yeetfile.com

# Configure the default view to enter when running the "yeetfile" command with
# no arguments. Can be set to "vault", "send", or "pass" (password vault)
default_view: "vault"

# Enable debug logging to a specific file
# debug_file: "~/.config/yeetfile/debug.log"
```

You can change the `server` directive to your own instance of YeetFile.

## Development

### Requirements

- Go v1.20+
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Node.js 22.2+
  - `npm install typescript`

### Setup

1. Start PostgreSQL
2. Create a database in PostgreSQL named "yeetfile"
    1. This can be customized to your preference, just use the `YEETFILE_DB_*` environment variables outlined
       below to configure before launching the server.
3. Build YeetFile server (see next section)
4. Run YeetFile server: `./yeetfile-server`

### Building

#### Server

`make backend`

#### CLI

`make cli`

All environment variables can be defined in a file named `.env` at the root level of the repo.
